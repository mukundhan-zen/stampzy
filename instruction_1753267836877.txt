Below is the task you need to complete.

TASK: Create a server action in `src/app/stamps/actions.ts` to fetch all stamps belonging to the current authenticated user. The action should:

- Handle errors and return user-friendly error messages

Whatever is required to implement this task (create / modify / delete files, components, pages, api routes, utils, etc), implement it. If you need to do any websearch let me know, I can do it for you. If you need clarification or encounter blockers, ask specific questions. Let me know after you completed this task.
